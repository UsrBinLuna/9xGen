##### ⚠️ NOTE: This software has not been tested in real world environments. I am not responsible for any damage caused to your device.
9xGen is a key generator for the Windows 9X family (95, 98, ME) and Microsoft Office 97. It also currently supports NT4.0 OEM and RTM keygen.

It uses the mod7 algorithm to generate keys, and <strong>does NOT currently support Windows 98 or ME. Support for these will be added in the future.</strong>

## Usage
Run `./keygen.sh` and select the key you want to generate.
