##### ⚠️ NOTE: This software has not been tested in real world environments. I am not responsible for any damage caused to your device.
9xGen is a key generator for the Windows 9X family (95, 98, ME) and Microsoft Office 97. 

It uses the mod7 algorithm to generate keys, and <strong>does NOT currently support Windows 98 or ME. Support for these will be added in the future.</strong> (NT4.0 might come too)

## Usage
Run `./keygen.sh` and select the key you want to generate.
